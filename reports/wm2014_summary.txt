This file summarizes the final simulation setup and results.


WM 2014 Monte Carlo Simulation (student version)
N simulations: 20000
Seed: 42
BASE_GOALS: 1.3
Output:
- reports/wm2014_title_probabilities.csv
- figures/wm2014_title_probabilities.png

Model notes:
- Group tie-break simplified: points, goal difference, then random.
- Knockout draws resolved by strength-weighted penalties.
